# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities publicly.**

If you believe you found a security vulnerability in this project, I encourage you to contact me privately using one of the following **encrypted** methods:
 - Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/@elastic-rock:matrix.org

I will try to get in touch with you as soon as possible (should be within 2 days) to discuss the matter and if needed, patch the vulnerability. After patching, the vulnerability will be publicaly disclosed and your contribution recognised by listing your name in the changelog or, upon request, other methods deemed relevant. You can then optionaly make a public discolsure.

Thank you!
